"""Ref -- a pointer from one record into another.

Without it every section is an island: a derived quantity cannot say what it
was derived from, a system cannot cite the parameter set it was typed with,
and a dataset cannot point at the configurations it indexes. One small type
turns a pile of sections into a graph.

``hash`` is optional but strongly recommended. A URI says *where* something
was; a content hash says *what* it was, and only the second survives a file
being moved, regenerated, or silently edited.
