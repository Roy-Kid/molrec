"""Store -- where one serialization lands.

A Store is created, reused, and destroyed by the suite. An adapter only uses
it; it never manages the lifecycle, never builds a path, never cleans up.

Two axes:

* **module axis** -- ``FrameStore`` / ``TrajectoryStore`` / ``MetricsStore``
  / ``DatasetStore``. Different modules have genuinely different access
  semantics (an array tree is not an append-only stream), so each declares
  its own abstract base.

* **backend axis** -- ``ZarrFrameStore`` / ``JsonlMetricsStore`` /
  ``SqliteMetricsStore`` ... The handle is backend-specific and typed. A
  database-backed store has no URI, so there is deliberately no universal
  ``uri`` field to paper over the difference.
