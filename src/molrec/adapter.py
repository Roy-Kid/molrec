"""Adapter -- the only thing an implementation author writes.

Two methods per module, and both directions are exercised:

* ``write(model, store)`` -- build your own object from the model, serialize
  it your way. The suite then reads the store back with the official codec.
* ``read(store)`` -- the suite wrote a canonical store with the official
  codec; hand back something shaped like the model.

``read`` may return anything duck-compatible: a dict, a dataclass, your own
native object. The suite validates it with ``from_attributes=True``. What it
must *not* do is assert -- every assertion belongs to the suite.
