"""Observables: a named quantity as a function of its coordinates.

Everything a run measures or an analysis computes is a function -- a training
loss over steps, a temperature over wall-clock time, an RDF over distance, a
free energy over two dihedrals, a density over a spatial grid. Writing that
as ``coordinates -> values`` makes the shape of the data enforce the idea,
rather than leaving it to a convention someone has to remember.

Dimensions are what make the shape unambiguous, and the ambiguity is real:
given coordinates ``phi`` and ``psi``, is the value a ``(n_phi, n_psi)`` grid
or ``n`` scattered samples? Naming dimensions answers it, and makes the
answer checkable::

    grid       phi.dims=(phi,)    psi.dims=(psi,)    values.dims=(phi, psi)
    scattered  phi.dims=(sample,) psi.dims=(sample,) values.dims=(sample,)
    a curve    step.dims=(point,) wall_time.dims=(point,) values.dims=(point,)

The third line is why a training curve needs no special case: ``step`` and
``wall_time`` are two coordinates over one dimension, which is a structural
fact rather than a convention.

Coordinates are held once for the whole section, as in an xarray ``Dataset``,
so a hundred curves sharing one axis store that axis once.

What is deliberately absent:

* **No rendering preference.** Whether an RDF is drawn as a line or a heatmap
  is decided later, by someone else, and differs between consumers -- so it
  is not contractual, and there is no wrong value to validate against.
* **No ``kind`` of scalar-versus-vector, and no ``time_dependent`` flag.**
  ``dims`` and ``shape`` already say both, and a fact stated twice is a fact
  that can disagree with itself.

What is *not* an observable: a **relation** (a bond joins two atoms; that is
not ``coordinate -> value``) and a **document** (``meta``, ``method`` and
``status`` have no domain at all). Topology stays in ``frame``.
