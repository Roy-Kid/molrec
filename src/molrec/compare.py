"""Model comparison -- never byte comparison.

Chunk size, codec, compression level, attribute key order and sharding are
all legitimate implementation freedom: two conforming stores *should* differ
at the byte level. So conformance is judged where the contract actually lives
-- on the model a conforming reader reconstructs.

The walk yields located violations rather than a bare ``False``, because
someone fixing a file wants the whole list, not one round trip per field.
