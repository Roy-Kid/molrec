# MolRec

MolRec is a backend-neutral specification that defines what a molecular record means.

This documentation is written for developers. It defines the semantics of each component — not one mandatory implementation or storage format.

## What problem does MolRec solve?

Atomistic simulation data is scattered across dozens of file formats (PDB, XYZ, LAMMPS, VASP, etc.), each with its own conventions for storing atoms, cells, trajectories, and computed quantities. MolRec provides a **single semantic model** that makes records self-describing and interoperable:

- A record always states **what** each dataset means, not just its shape.
- Metadata is mandatory where it matters — you never have to guess whether an array is an energy, a force, or a charge density.
- The model covers classical MD, ML potentials, electronic structure, and multi-stage workflows.

## Core concepts

### Frame

The canonical snapshot of the system. Contains **named collections** (atoms, bonds, angles, beads, fragments, ...), optional **grids** (volumetric fields), and an optional **box** (simulation cell).

Frame is not restricted to atoms. Any entity set with a count and aligned per-entity arrays is a valid collection.

### Box

The simulation cell lives on **frame** as the `box` property. Each frame carries its own cell vectors, origin, and periodic boundary conditions.

For trajectories, each frame stores its own box — supporting both fixed-cell and variable-cell simulations naturally.

### Trajectory

A logical list of frame-like snapshots, packed into aligned arrays grouped by collection. Trajectories are **collection-based, not atoms-only** — bonds, angles, and any named collection can evolve over time.

### Observables

Derived or reported quantities, each stored as a `name` / `meta.<name>` pair. MolRec defines three observable data kinds:

| Kind | Example | Data |
|------|---------|------|
| **Scalar** | total energy, temperature | `Column` (1-D array) |
| **Vector** | dipole moment, momentum | `Column` (N-D array) |
| **Grid** | charge density, spin density | `Grid` (volumetric field) |

Every observable must carry explicit metadata: `kind`, `description`, `time_dependent`, and optionally `unit`, `axes`, `sampling`, `domain`.

### Grid

A data structure representing values on a uniform 3-D spatial grid. Defined by `dim`, `origin`, `cell`, `pbc`, and one or more named scalar arrays. Grid appears in two places:

- **In frame**: as part of the canonical snapshot (e.g., `frame["chgcar"]`).
- **In observables**: as `ObservableKind::Grid`, carrying semantic metadata (description, unit, etc.).

### Method

Typed scientific context describing how the record was produced. Supports `classical`, `ml`, `electronic_structure`, `workflow`, and custom types.
